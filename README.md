# simpleCourtTimers

My sister, who is president of the UC Davis Badminton Club, asked me to code a program to keep track of badminton court availability for their upcoming 2022 Davis Spring Open tournament.

The table represents the 16 courts with buttons to start timers for each court's warm up sessions. Once a timer is set, each court has 5 minutes to warm up before their game starts and is indicated with a yellow background color and an updated status of "Warming up". Once the timer ends, this is indicated by an updated status of "In game" with a red background color. A reset button can reset the court to available from either state of warming up during a timer or in game.
